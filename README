FELPulseSimulator
----------------------

1.) Purpose
This program serves as an interface to FEL pulse data from the XFEL Pulse Database at http://in.xfel.eu/xpd.
It allows to simulate a pulse train by specifying the pulse duration, the photon energy, and the pulse separation. After initialization, the user can then query for a pulse. The return from this query is a randomly picked XFEL pulse, represented as intensity as function of time and a time stamp, giving he offset of the pulse from the start of the first pulse in the pulse train.

2.) Dependencies
Besides standard python modules (numpy, h5py), the program needs to have
access to the hdf5 files from the XFEL Pulse Database (XPD). After submitting a request to the database via the web interface http://in.xfel.eu/xpd, the requestor is provided with a link where the files can be downloaded. After
download, copy the .h5 files to a directory in FELPulseSimulator/pulse_database/xxxx_yyy/ . xxxx specifies the photon energy in eV and yyy gives the pulse duration in fs. As an example, data for 3fs pulses at 4.96 keV would go
into FELPulseSimulator/pulse_database/4960_003/.

3.) Usage: The test module FELPulseSimulator/python/PulseTrainSimulationTest.py provides a usage example.
